# OS-labs
 
# Lab_1

In first lab I used processes and processes.exitValue() to implement paralel computation of two functions F and G in different processes and then compute main result in main process. Also I used Swing library to read input from keyboard. So in program you can press ESC button and prompt will appear in console with options to stop or continue program.
My variant:variant 9(Use Java, processes and process exit status for result of function computation) with Int arguments and Min as main function.
